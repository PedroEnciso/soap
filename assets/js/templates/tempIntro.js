      <p>However, if you're interested in reading a research report on organisational security policies and their role in civil society organisations then you're in luck!</p>
      <p>Securing Civil Society is the result of several months of research into the practices, processes and problems involved when civil society organisations consider implementing a security policy. Based on interviews with individuals representing 14 organisations from around the world, this 25-page report examines questions such as:</p>
      <ul><li>What do organisations usually put in their security policy?</li><li>What are the common barriers they face when implementing a policy?</li><li>How do organisations without a policy manage their security?</li></ul>
