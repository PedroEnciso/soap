This can be useful, for example, when you have a large organisation with several departments for whom the full policy may not be applicable. For instance, your finance team might not require the travel security section, or your volunteers may only need to know about your organisation's account and device security rules.", "In the left column you can specify who these smaller policies should be for - double-click the buttons to name your teams, or press the + button to add up to 10 groups.
