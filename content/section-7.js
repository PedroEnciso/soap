This can be useful if your organisation has several departments for whom the full policy may not be applicable. For instance, your finance team might not require the travel security section, or your volunteers may only need to know about your organisation's account and device security rules.", "In the left column you can specify who these shorter policies should be for. Name and select a team to see the policy areas that will be included in their subpolicy - choose as many as are applicable. Incident response measures and contextual information are included in all team policies by default.", "You can see what's in each policy area by checking the preview. When you're done, just hit Next and your team policies will be available along with your full policy on the next page. If you don't need any team policies then leave everything unselected and you'll get just your full policy and appendix."],
