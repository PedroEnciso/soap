Although such flexibility allows organisations to adapt quickly to new threats, it makes it harder to ensure everyone is working to the same security standard and that new staff are prepared for basic security incidents. SOAP only requires answers for the basic contextual questions, so you’re free to skip any areas you don’t want to define in a policy – giving you a set of security rules that everyone can work with."

You can preview your policy at any stage, and each question is accompanied by information to help you understand, research and implement the associated practices. Building on the research behind this project, the SOAP process focuses on 7 key areas commonly included in policies, for instance, devices, accounts and travel security. Each of these sections is preceded by a hypothetical, but common, security incident in order to set the questions within a context of a realistic threat and help you prepare staff with basic incident response steps."

Firstly, SOAP is a web app that works solely in your browser: no cookies or server-side processing is involved in building your policy. No IP addresses, web logs or any text entered into the answer boxes is stored or sent back to the SOAP servers.","Like many websites, SOAP relies upon Javascript to achieve its functionality and so, if it is not already, it should be enabled in your browser (hint: if you’re reading this, it’s already enabled). If your threat model means you can’t turn Javascript on, then you can download the code (github.com/gembarrett/soap) to run the tool in your own secure environment.","Collecting statistics on things like unpopular questions makes it easier to improve SOAP, but it’s important that you share that information willingly. So, if you wish to opt-in to basic usage data collection, you can give or revoke consent at any point before the end of the policy building process. And if you don’t want to opt-in, that’s fine too.","Got concerns? Email <a href='mailto:feedback@usesoap.app'>feedback@usesoap.app</a>"]

        "desc":["The name SOAP stands for Securing Organisations with Automated Policymaking, and reflects the intent to \"clean up\" organisational security policies which are so often stored in unread documents, irrelevant and ignored.","SOAP has been researched, designed and built by Gem Barrett, with funding from the Open Technology Fund. The idea for a security policy generator stemmed from a need they recognised during their work in rapid response coordination; many of the clients needed to meet a baseline level of security but various barriers had prevented them from having a security policy.","The research stage involved conducting interviews with various organisations to understand the frustrations they faced when creating, implementing and maintaining security policies. The findings of these interviews are shared in the report <a href='/assets/SecuringCivilSociety-report.pdf'>“Securing Civil Society”</a> (PDF in English, other versions coming soon). Research was also conducted into organisational security best practices and was added to the interview findings to create a methodology that forms the basis of SOAP’s process."]
