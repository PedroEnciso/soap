In particular, SOAP is geared towards helping civil society organizations (“CSOs”) and other mission-driven groups increase their digital resilience by building an organizational security policy that works for their specific situation.","So whether your organization needs to update an existing policy, create an entirely new one, or is just preparing to work with a security consultant, SOAP can help!", "Research indicates nearly half of all CSOs don’t have a security policy. These organizations instead rely on informal guidelines and “trust” to manage their security. In today’s world, that’s not enough. Although such flexibility allows organizations to adapt quickly to new threats, it makes it much harder to ensure workers are operating under the same security standard. And new members are often left unprepared for even the most basic security incidents. SOAP provides a set of security rules that everyone can work with—all totally customizable to your organization’s specific needs."]

You can preview your policy at any point, and each question is accompanied by information to help you fully understand, research, and implement the associated practices. SOAP’s unique process focuses on seven key areas commonly included in policies, like devices or travel security. Each section is preceded by a hypothetical—but common—security incident to help orient the questions within the context of a realistic threat."

No IP addresses, web logs, or any text entered into the answer boxes is stored or sent back to the SOAP servers. Like many websites, SOAP relies on Javascript to achieve its functionality, so it must be enabled in your browser for SOAP to work (hint: if you’re reading this, it’s already enabled). If your threat model means you can’t turn on Javascript, you can download the code (github.com/gembarrett/soap) to run the tool in your own secure environment. Questions? Concerns?

The acronym stands for Securing Organizations with Automated Policymaking—reflecting the need to \"clean up\" standard organizational security policies, which all-too-often are unread, irrelevant, or ignored. Thanks to SOAP, organizations can now customize their own unique security policies. Say goodbye to the one-size-fits-all approaches of the past! And along the way, SOAP provides support and implementation tips to ensure the entire process is as easy as possible.", "SOAP was researched, designed, and built by Gem Barrett, with funding from the Open Technology Fund. The need for a program like SOAP became apparent through their work in online rapid response coordination. Many organizations need to meet a baseline level of security but for various reasons are prevented from having a policy that works for them. SOAP seeks to change that.","In developing SOAP, research was conducted to understand the frustrations faced and obstacles encountered by organizations when creating, implementing, and maintaining security policies. The findings of this research and accompanying interviews are shared in the report <a href='/assets/SecuringCivilSociety-report.pdf'>“Securing Civil Society”</a> (PDF currently available in English, other versions coming soon). These findings, coupled with research into organizational security best practices, helped create the methodology that forms the basis of SOAP’s innovative process."]
