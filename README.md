# Security Policy Generator
## The Security Policy Generator aims to help organisations improve their security resilience by providing a free, easy-to-use tool for building security policies that are thorough, straightforward and realistic. 
The tool will take the form of an online interface that guides the user through a series of questions, culminating in a security policy that is appropriate to their needs and accompanied by an appendix of additional tips and resources for implementation and future maintenance.
